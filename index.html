            <p class="animation_bounce">
                Describing myself in a few words has always been the most arduous task for me.To begin with,I'm a 1st year student at PEC University of technology,pursuing B.E in Computer Science and Engineering.
              </p>
              <p>
              For someone who meets me in person for the first time,I pass off as a cheerful and joyful person who talks a lot.I take time in making friends and also allow them to make themselves comfortable around me.But once this code of conduct has been successsfully abided by,I make sure that I prove my loyalty to the ones close to me.
              </p>
              <p>
                Travelling,playing guitar,watching movies are some of the things I'm always interested in.
              </p>
              <p>
              Confident about myself,trusting and hardworking,a loyal and trustworthy friend,yea..that would be me.

                  <p> Attending the rose fest is not a big deal for sure.The big wheel ride that too while it was raining made our day.
                    Clicking photos in almost all weird poses,we made a lot of memories that day.Had an amazing time walking our way to the the chinese market talking shit all the way.</p>
